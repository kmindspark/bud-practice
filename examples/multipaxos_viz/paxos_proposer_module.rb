    #The number n must be greater than any number used in any of the previous Prepare messages by this Proposer. Then, it sends the Prepare message containing n to a Quorum of Acceptors.

    #to the value associated with the highest proposal number reported by the Acceptors, let's call it z. If none of the Acceptors had accepted a proposal up to this 
    #point, then the Proposer may choose the value it originally wanted to propose, say x[17]. The Proposer sends an Accept message, (n, v), to a Quorum of Acceptors 
    #with the chosen value for its proposal, v, and the proposal number n (which is the same as the number contained in the Prepare message previously sent to the Acceptors).
    #So, the Accept message is either (n, v=z) or, in case none of the Acceptors previously accepted a value, (n, v=x).
